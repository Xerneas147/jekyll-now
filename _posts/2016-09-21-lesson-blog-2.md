    <td>I found that searching things that I didn't know on the infinite bank of knowledge also known as the world wide web was very helpful. I found that w3schools was a useful website for finding helpful information about css. I also used my previous knowledge from year 6 when I made a website in html and css, at the time I was so proud but looking back on it I looked like a 3 year old made it.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by my constant need to look up anything I could work out for myself (oh no I forgot how to type an F. I know I’ll google it). I also let myself get a tiny bit carried away with editing… well anything. So I edited anything I could. I edited the font, the margin, the colour, the hyperlink. I even made the pointer into a crosshair. So now it all looks a bit silly. In future I need to remember not to change anything I physically can.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work slower and more methodically through all the work and not just brashly rushing in and making everything look a lot worse because of it. Next lesson I will work harder to take a step back and look at it again before adding even more additions that my website doesn’t need and I’ll need to work harder on stopping myself getting carried away. </td>
