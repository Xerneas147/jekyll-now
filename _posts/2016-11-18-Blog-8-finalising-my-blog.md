  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by learning from others. I did this by looking at others blogs to get ideas that could help my blog some of their ideas I feel greatly improved my blog. Also looking at professional websites made my ideas start to flow. I also made sure to check my work as I went along as to not break my website and forget what did it. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My inability to focus during the lesson ment I often forget important points about what makes a good blog. I need to focus on the core points in my blog instead of focusing on making it look good. I also need to try harder when writing my blog as I often sidetrack it instead making my blog to make my website look good instead as I will get marked on writing as well as my website looking good.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will work harder on new ideas that I can't do instead of playing it safe and not learning. I will also focus more on my blog post to make it more coherent and better to read I will also extend my blog posts to make them longer as right now they are fairly short and don't show much effort.  I will work on creating funnier and new additions to my website. </td>
