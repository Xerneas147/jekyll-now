    <td>I found that splitting things up into easier chunks and made sure that I did everything step by step and checked stuff off as to not forget any of the parts of my sheet. I made sure that all my commands worked and if they didn't went through it logically to find out what made it break</td>

    <td>I need to work on making my sheet more neat and less scruffy to avoid it being confusing and causing people to be sick just looking at it. I need to I need to stop getting distracted by how others are doing and trying to help them as I need to focus on what I am doing myself.</td>

    <td>Next time I will try to go into more depth and try new commands and designs to make it more realistic and structured. I also need to work on making an effort towards making it look as good a possible as this lesson I really sidelined my looks of my sheet and focussed on commands.</td>
