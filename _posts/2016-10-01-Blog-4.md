    <td>I found that asking my peers for help with elements of coding I didn't understand was a good way to find out stuff that I didn't know. I found that planning and thinking logically was a good way to avoid having to backtrack as I work as pre planned which is what avoided me having to backtrack as before I did anything I knew what I wanted to do.

    <td>I need to work on my development of my coding knowledge as currently I am using very basic techniques and I need to create more advanced and harder techniques to make my blog look as good as it can be.. I will need to make sure that I allow myself enough time to do all the coding needed to be done during the lesson as to not add to the backlog of homework.</td>

    <td>Next lesson I will use the internet to find better ways to improve my blog to make it look good and work one step at a time. After each change I will look at my blog. And see what changes my website needs to make it look better. I will also work on my time management as to not over run and increase the amount of homework that I need to complete.</td>
