    <td>I tried new things and made mistakes. I found it was better to make mistakes trying new things than playing it safe. As i can go back and change if it didn't work. Also I tried asking my parents what they thought so I could get some more ideas about how to change it. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to concentrate more as I kept getting distracted and messing about during the lesson as I kept seeing what everyone else was doing  and getting distracted by their work instead of concentrating on my own work. Instead of worrying about others.

    <td>next time I will ask more questions to better my understanding I also need to concentrate on not getting too much help from the teacher and focus on finding things out for myself. Next time I will work harder on learning new ways to do things instead of the boring well trodden path. </td>
